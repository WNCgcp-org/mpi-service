## Project Scoping Methodology

When presented with a new project, you should:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements
Ask strategic questions to understand:

1. **Domain & Context**
   - What type of data are you processing? (PHI, PII, financial, etc.)
   - What are the compliance requirements?
   - What's the expected scale? (users, requests/sec, data volume)
   - Are there existing systems to integrate with?

2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - What data comes in and from where?
   - What transformations are needed?
   - What data needs to be stored vs cached vs computed?
   - How long should data be retained?

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - What external systems need to be called?
   - Are there multiple providers for the same functionality?
   - What's the fallback strategy if a provider fails?
   - Do you need real-time vs batch processing?

4. **Performance & Scale Requirements**
   - What are the latency requirements (P95, P99)?
   - Expected throughput (requests/sec)?
   - Concurrent user expectations?
   - Data size expectations?

### Phase 2: Architecture Recommendations

Based on the discovery, proactively suggest:

1. **Architectural Patterns**
   ```
   If processing sensitive data → Recommend hash-based storage + audit trails
   If multiple providers → Recommend provider pattern with fallback
   If high throughput → Recommend multi-level caching + connection pooling
   If bulk operations → Recommend correlation ID pattern + streaming APIs
   ```

2. **Technology Stack**
   - **High-performance APIs**: FastAPI + uvloop + orjson
   - **Caching**: Redis for L2, MongoDB for L3 persistence
   - **Database**: MongoDB with proper indexing strategies
   - **Async processing**: asyncio with connection pooling

3. **Data Strategy**
   - **Cache layers**: Memory (L1) → Redis (L2) → Database (L3) → External APIs
   - **Sensitive data**: Hash storage with correlation lookups
   - **Audit trails**: All operations with timestamps and correlation IDs
   - **TTL strategies**: Based on data sensitivity and update frequency

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

Guide the implementation with:

1. **Project Structure**
   ```
   src/
   ├── core/
   │   ├── dependencies.py    # Dependency injection
   │   ├── config.py         # Configuration management
   │   └── cache.py          # Caching utilities
   ├── domains/
   │   └── {domain_name}/
   │       ├── controllers/   # API endpoints
   │       ├── services/      # Business logic
